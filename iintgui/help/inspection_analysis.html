<p>The last interactive section of the GUI is the part of &quot;Inspection and Analysis&quot;.</p>
<p>In total four different actions are available by buttons.</p>
<h5 id="iint-gui-&quot;ShowInspectionPlots&quot;">&quot;Show Inspection Plots&quot;</h5>
<p>This will create and show a pdf file containing scatter plots of the final fit parameter vs. the values of the chosen tracked data (see above).</p>
<p>It will always include a scatter plot showing the values of the integrated intensities of the scans by the fit and the trapezoidal sum.</p>
<h5 id="iint-gui-&quot;Polarizationanalysis&quot;">&quot;Polarization analysis&quot;</h5>
<p>In case the processing of the scan series contains all necessary information, the procedure for the polarization analysis is performed.</p>
<p>A &quot;.stokes&quot; results file is then created in the output directory.</p>
<p>Also a pdf of the fit result plots will be created and shown in a pdf viewer.</p>
<h5 id="iint-gui-&quot;Showfittedscans&quot;">&quot;Show fitted scans&quot;</h5>
<p>Create and displays a pdf file of all the scans with the superimposed fit curve; e.g. for checking the fits of the whole series.</p>
<h5 id="iint-gui-&quot;Saveresults&quot;">&quot;Save results&quot;</h5>
<p>This will create all pdfs (inspection plots, fitted scans), as well as a text output file containing all fitted and tracked data.</p>
