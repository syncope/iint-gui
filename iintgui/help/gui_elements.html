<h1>GUI Elements</h1>
<p>The main window is horizontally split into two parts.</p>
<p>The left hand side is dedicated for the steering of the processing steps, and displaying the current status of the processing.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the left side, the log message window is present.</p>
<p>The entire right hand side is for displaying the data and the graphical representation of the processing results, as available.</p>
<h2>The left hand side: steering </h2>
<p>From top to bottom, the steps for processing are given in order.</p>
<p>At the very top information is shown about the current data file and the output directory.</p>
<h3 id="iint-gui-Selectinganoutputdirectory">Selecting an output directory</h3>
<p>The current output directory is shown in the second line of the main window.</p>
<p>iint-gui automatically creates a configuration file, as well as several other files on demand; all of which will be stored at that given location.</p>
<p>By default the output directory is the home directory of the user that started the program.</p>
<p>To change the directory, click the &quot;Select&quot; button and chose a directory in the appearing dialog.</p>

<h3 id="iint-gui-Thelogsection">The log section</h3>
<p>The lowermost part of the left side is dedicated for message about the actions that are performed with the data.</p>
<p>Most of the time it will just show what is being done.</p>
<p>Sometimes warning may appear in red text, informing the user that something has not worked as expected.</p>
<p>Most of the time a reason can be hinted at, why the action could not be performed successfully.</p>

<h2 id="iint-gui-Theplottingsection">Right hand side: plot display</h2>
<p>The right hand part of the GUI is dedicated to showing the data. It features several options to inspect the data more closely.</p>
<p>If a scan (series) has been defined, and the observable declared, the &quot;Scan display&quot; is the main part.</p>
<h2 id="iint-gui-Toppart">Top part</h2>
<p>Above the plotting part, the Scan ID is shown, as read from the SPEC file.</p>
<p>Also in the top part there is the possibility to browse through the scan series by clicking on the &quot;Prev&quot; and &quot;Next&quot; buttons.</p>
<p>For display purposes only a scan can be removed from being displayed in the fit overview plots.</p>
<p>For this click on the green &quot;Remove from display&quot; button.</p>
<p>If the scan has already been excluded from display, the same button will appear as red and be named &quot;Add to display again&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="iint-gui-Maindisplay">Main display</h2>
<p>Here the data points are plotted.</p>
<p>The raw observable (as defined in the observable section) will be displayed as black plus &quot;+&quot; signs.</p>
<p>In case de-spiking was applied, the de-spiked data points will be shown as dark green &quot;x&quot;.</p>
<p>Background will be shown as filled red diamonds, the background subtracted signal is then shown as filled blue circles.</p>
<p>The temporary fit during the configuration is shown as a solid red line; the final fit result is shown as solid blue line.</p>
<h2 id="iint-gui-Bottompart">Bottom part</h2>
<p>A few things about the main display can be configured directly.</p>
<p>To display the data in logarithmic ordinate, the check box &quot;logScale&quot; can be toggled.</p>
<p>Since negative values or zero cannot be an argument to the logarithm, there is a lower cutoff of 0.01.</p>
<p>To show the position of the mouse click on the main display, the x and y values are displayed.</p>
<p>If the respective data is present, the check boxes can be toggled to display the raw, de-spiked, background, signal and fit data.</p>
